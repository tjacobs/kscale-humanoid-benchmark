## Getting Started

You can use this repository as a GitHub template or as a Google Colab.

### Google Colab

You can quickly try out the humanoid benchmark by running the [training notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kscalelabs/kscale-humanoid-benchmark/blob/master/train.ipynb) in Google Colab.

### Template

1. Read through the [current leaderboard](https://url.kscale.dev/leaderboard) submissions and through the [ksim examples](https://github.com/kscalelabs/ksim/tree/master/examples)
2. Create a new repository from this template by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=kscale-humanoid-benchmark&template_owner=kscalelabs)
3. Make sure you have installed `git-lfs`:

```bash
sudo apt install git-lfs  # Ubuntu
brew install git-lfs  # MacOS
```

4. Clone the new repository you create from this template:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR USERNAME>/kscale-humanoid-benchmark.git
cd kscale-humanoid-benchmark
```

5. Create a new Python environment (we require Python 3.11 or later)
6. Install the package with its dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install 'jax[cuda12]'  # If using GPU machine, install Jax CUDA libraries
```

7. Train a policy:

```bash
python -m train
```

8. Update the policy weights in `assets` and run the deployment script on your new policy:

```bash
python -m deploy
```

9. Add a video of your new policy to this README
10. Push your code and model to your repository, and make sure the repository is public
11. Write a message with a link to your repository on our [Discord](https://url.kscale.dev/discord) in the "【🧠】submissions" channel
12. Wait for one of us to run it on the real robot - this should take about a day
13. Voila! Your name will now appear on our [leaderboard](https://url.kscale.dev/leaderboard)


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please consult the [ksim documentation](https://docs.kscale.dev/docs/ksim#/) or reach out to us on [Discord](https://url.kscale.dev/docs).

## Tips and Tricks

To see all the available command line arguments, use the command:

```bash
python -m train --help
```

To visualize running your model without using `kos-sim`, use the command:

```bash
python -m train run_model_viewer=True
```

This repository contains a pre-trained checkpoint, which is useful for both jump-starting model training and understanding the codebase. To initialize training from this checkpoint, use the command:

```bash
python -m train load_from_ckpt_path=assets/ckpt.bin
```

If you want to use the Jupyter notebook and don't want to commit your training logs, we suggest using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to clean the notebook before committing:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
